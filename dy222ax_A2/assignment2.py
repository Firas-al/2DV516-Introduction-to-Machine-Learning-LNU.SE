@Instructions:
    - Certain quantitive questions in Exercise 1, can simply be handled as a 
    print statement in the program, ie: 
        ... What is the expected benchmark result for a certain graphics card? 
    - More qualitative questions should be handled as a comment in the notebook 
    or in a separate text file, ie:
        ... Motivate your choice of model.
    - All such answers can be grouped into a single text-file.
    - The non-mandatory VG-exercise will require a separate report.
